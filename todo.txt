# Introduction fixes
- add historical context of pareto distribution (mention at least all forms)
- specify we're dealing with the generalized pareto (find the proper form)

# methodology
- Reorder deviance section according to minutes/bruno's notes

# Results
- Recompute results with Linf model--see if it actually improves anything.

# Ideas
- Add simulation section -- recovery of simulated datasets, cluster counts, etc..
- define epsilon cones in angular space--calculate probability of cones
- work on other
